		<h1>About me</h1>

		<p class="lead text-justify">Soon after my graduation I spent two months travelling across Australia and once back home I found my first job in IT. From that moment on I have been working on small, medium and large projects with many people all around the world, I led a small team and acted as a single point of contact between international technical and business teams.</p>
		<p class="lead text-justify">I am very interested in Android and development of mobile applications.</p>
		<p class="lead text-justify">In my free time I run some personal (open source) projects, I like to read books, play guitar, shoot photos and cook for my friends.</p>
