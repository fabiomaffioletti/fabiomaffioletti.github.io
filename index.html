		<p>Technology leader with 14+ years of professional experience working in product development organizations as software engineer, engineering manager and head of engineering. I took the managerial path after ~10 years in software engineering and architecture, and in the last years I have been building and leading cross-functional, co-located and distributed agile product development teams for start-ups/scale-ups and enterprises.</p>
		<p>I like to contribute to the creation and organization of high performing teams based on collaboration, communication and healthy application of Agile principles. I like to be part of and collaborate in creating a work environment where all people can feel safe, listened, belonging, freely contribute and strive for everyone's success while also improving their lives and grow as individuals and professionals.</p>
		<p>In my free time I run some personal (open source) projects, I like to read books, play guitar, shoot photos, taste wines and cook for my friends.</p>
